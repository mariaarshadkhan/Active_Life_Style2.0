<h2 id="
yoga">What is Yoga?</h2>
<p>
Derived from the Sanskrit word <b>yuj<b>, Yoga means union of the individual consciousness or soul with the Universal Consciousness or Spirit.
 Yoga is a 5000-year-old Indian body of knowledge. Though many think of yoga only as a physical exercise where people twist, turn,
  stretch, and breathe in the most complex ways, these are actually only the most superficial aspect of this profound science of 
  unfolding the infinite potentials of the human mind and soul. The science of Yoga imbibes the complete essence of the Way of Life.</p>

    <dt>Mudras</dt>
    <dd>Mudras are easy to perform anytime, although sitting in the lotus position and focusing on the healing can be an advantage.
       Although mudras can be used for healing certain ailments, regular practise of mudras will contribute to your overall good health 
       and can be used as a preventive measure. Continuous practice of the mudras will 
       create minute changes in your body using pulse centres on parts of your hands,
        which trigger certain healing processes within the corresponding body part.</dd>
        <hr>

        <dt> Hasta Mudra (Hand Mudra)</dt>
        <dd>The physical body is made up of five elements namely, Air, Water, Fire, Earth and Sky. 
          A mudra is a gesture or positioning of the hands intended to direct energy flow and to connect parts of the body to the brain as life force energy flows through the body.
           Certain yoga mudras are believed to instigate particular energy flows and stimulate different emotions, spiritual reactions and reactions in the body. By pressing together, curling, touching or pointing different fingers or parts of the hands in different ways, you can stimulate reflexes from the hand to the brain.</dd>

       <dd>Believe it or not, your health is in your hands! Our hands are particularly blessed with virtues of wellness. The four fingers and the thumb represent the five major building blocks or the ‘Panchamahabhootas’ of which the entire universe is made viz. Sky (Ether), Air, Fire, Water and Earth.</dd>
       <p>According to natural sciences, disease is nothing but a limitation that emerges in the continuity and balance of these five elements.</p>

  <h3>Philosophy of Mudra Therapy</h3>
<p><img src="images/m1.gif" alt="theerapy" width="200" height="200"

<li>Middle finger – The ether (Aakasha)</li>
<li>Ring finger – The earth (Prithvi)</li>
<li>Small finger – The water (Jala)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to bring back the balance in the five elements, there are some specific methods of touching and aligning the fingers with each other. These are referred to as ‘Hast-Mudras’ and this easy and doable therapy may be practiced anytime as an augmented relief from your malady as well as a handy tool for restoring your wellness</p>
